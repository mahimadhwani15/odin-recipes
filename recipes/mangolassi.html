    <h1>Mango Lassi</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like a cross between a milkshake and a smoothie, mango lassi is a simple pleasure: All you need is about equal amounts of sweet mangoes and creamy full-fat yogurt, a little ice, and a high-powered blender to force the two ingredients into one drinkable treat.</p>
    <p>To prep your mangoes, give your fruit a nice little rinse under water, dry it off, then make two cuts slicing the fruit off either side of the seed. Score the sliced halves into cubes, then use a spoon to carve off the flesh straight into your blender. You can peel off the skin of the mango and trim around the seed to yield even more fruit.</p>
    <p>If you’re using Greek yogurt, you will probably need to add a little more milk or water as needed to loosen the lassi to your desired consistency. There is no hard and fast rule about how thick or thin your lassi needs to be—it’s all about how you want it—but I like to keep it just thinned out enough that it’s still drinkable through a straw.</p>
    <p>If your mangoes are out of season and aren’t quite sweet, I like to drizzle in a touch of honey to add a little sugary touch to my glass—you can also use sweetened condensed milk or sugar. Traditionally, mango lassi can be flavored with a pinch of saffron or ground cardamom, or a drop of rosewater—these are completely optional, and just a teensy touch of either one will go a long way to give your drink a more savory or floral tint.</p>
